The company from the last question, AMPLION HOLDING, LLC, is linked to a New York address. What other company, linked to our person of interest, shares this address?

Hint - 1 (Cost: 4 points)
Although searching from an address isn't possible with the free tier OpenCorporates, searching directly on the Florida register (https://dos.fl.gov/sunbiz/search/) should help you.
