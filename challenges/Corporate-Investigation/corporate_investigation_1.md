We looked at Arto Autio in the "Whois Records" series of questions (you do not need to complete them to answer these questions). In this excellent article by Yana Mickevich and Usevalad Shlykau from the Belarusian Investigation Center (link: https://investigatebel.org/en/investigations/finskij-prestupnik-v-belarusi), an English company is mentionned but its name is not given. What British company has Arto Autio in his paperwork?

Hint - 1 (Cost: 3 points)
British companies can easily be found from a variety of data point (name, address, officer name, etc.) by searching on this website: https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/
